# Ultrasonic-Radar-Visualization-with Arduino and Processing

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project demonstrates a radar-like system that uses an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to detect and visualize objects within a specified range. The visualization is implemented using Processing, which displays real-time radar-like graphics based on data received from an Arduino.

# FEATURES:
* Object Detection: Uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the distance of objects within a 180° sweep.
* Real-Time Visualization: Displays detected objects on a radar interface with circles representing object positions.
* Dynamic Angle Updates: The servo motor continuously rotates between 0° and 180°, while the radar visualization updates in real-time.
* Distance-Based Alerts: Marks objects within a defined range (e.g., less than 40 cm).
*Customizable Design: Includes arcs, lines, and labels to represent angles (30°, 60°, etc.) and distance markers (10 cm, 20 cm, etc.).
